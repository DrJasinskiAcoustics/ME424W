    "The goal is to plot the motion of a pendulum with known physical quantities. Let's consider the type of pendulum shown below, with a length of string and a large washer at the end.  We can vary the length of the pendulum in our simulation to determine how that will impact the oscillation of the pendulum.  Additionally, we know that the oscillation of tis pendulum will not be endless, so we should model some amount of damping to account for the energy drained from the system over time.  We can determine the differential equation of motion for a damped pendulum with no spring, and we will need some Python tools to solve it for an equation of motion. Please note that each 'cell' of this Notebook must be run in order to ensure each of the variables is correctly assigned."
