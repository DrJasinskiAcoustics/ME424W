# ME 424W

This is an interactive demo made in Python using a Jupyter Notebook.  In order to access the notebook, you can install Jupter Notebook (https://jupyter.org/install) on your personal computer, or follow the Binder link on our Blackboard page.

This Notebook will complete Example 25.6 as outlined in the Megson text. The textbook describes the process for using Matlab to solve for the direct and shear strains on the ply, but this adaptation uses Python, so note that there are several small differences in operation symbols and syntax.
